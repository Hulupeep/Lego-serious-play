## Overview
 
This LEGO Serious Play challenge is designed to simulate real-world collaboration under ambiguity, constraint, and limited resources. Teams must work together to build a solution to a problem they don’t fully understand—while communicating through a single "Architect" who holds the secret.
 
The workshop emphasizes:
- Communication clarity
- Managing ambiguity
- Negotiating scarce resources
- Role clarity under pressure
 
---
 
## Learning Objectives
 
By the end of the session, participants will have experienced:
- Leading and building under uncertainty
- The impact of unclear requirements
- How constraints affect collaboration
- Trade-offs between planning and action
 
---
 
## Setup
 
### Materials
- LEGO bricks sorted into **3 shared bowls** per team
- Pre-built “cargo” (e.g., an animal in a small cage) hidden among the pieces
- Printed instructions or devices for viewing:
  - `facilitator_script.md`
  - `architect.md`
  - `participants.md`
 
### Room Setup
- Separate tables or zones for 3–4 teams
- A central area where you can call Architects aside

- **Team Members:** Must interpret, build, and adapt without seeing the original.
