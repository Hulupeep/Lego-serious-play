# Participant Instructions: Mission – Secure the Cargo
 
Welcome to the challenge.
 
You are part of a team tasked with building something that will **get the cargo to its destination safely**.
 
What the cargo is—and how to transport it—will become clear as you build.
 
---
 
## What You Need to Know
 
- One member of your team is the **Architect**.
- The Architect has seen the final build, but **they are not allowed to build or touch LEGO bricks**.
- The Architect will **guide you using only verbal communication**.
 
---
 
## Your Role
 
- Work as a team to build the solution based on your Architect's guidance.
- You can take LEGO pieces freely from the shared bowls—but you’ll quickly realize **resources are limited**.
- You may need to **collaborate or negotiate with other teams** if you’re missing key pieces.
 
---
 
## Things You *Cannot* Do
 
- Do not ask your Architect to tell you what the structure is.
- Don’t expect step-by-step instructions.
- You’re not trying to guess what the thing is—you’re trying to **build something that works** based on limited input.

## Tip:
 
Listen carefully. Think critically. Build creatively. And don’t be afraid to try something bold.
 
You’ll find out soon enough if your solution can carry the cargo.
 
Good luck.
