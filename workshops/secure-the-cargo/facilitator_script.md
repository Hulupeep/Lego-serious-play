# Facilitator Script – “Mission: Secure the Cargo”
Total Time: 25–30 minutes
(Based on your 20-minute build time plus intro and wrap-up)

1. Welcome & Setup (2–3 min)
“Welcome, everyone. You’re about to do a LEGO challenge.
It’s going to take about 20 minutes, and it’s designed to help you think about how we communicate, handle ambiguity, and manage resources as a team.
Let’s start by splitting into three teams.”
(Give them a moment to self-organize)
“Great. Now, in each team, choose one person to be the Architect.
This person will guide the team, but they cannot build, touch bricks, or say what the structure or cargo is.”


2. Assign Architect Role (2 min)
“Architects, please come with me for a moment.”
(Take them aside and show them the photo of the final build)
Hand them these key instructions verbally or on a printed card:
Architect Private Briefing:
*“Your team’s mission is to build something that will get the cargo to its destination safely. They do not know what the cargo is yet.
You're only allowed to confirm once they identify it correctly (e.g., pull out the animal and ask, ‘Is this the cargo?’).
You may guide them by asking questions or suggesting things like:
‘How might you keep something secure?’
‘What shape would help it stay in place?’
‘Do you think that’s enough protection?’ But you cannot:
Say what the object is
Give any names like ‘animal,’ ‘cage,’ ‘boat,’ etc.
Give brick-by-brick instructions
Touch or point to anything You are managing scarce resources and communication under constraint.”*


3. Start the Build (15–20 min)
Back in the room:
“Architects, return to your teams. Your goal is to build something that will get the cargo to its destination safely. You’ll find everything you need in the three bowls of LEGO.
Only the Architect knows the full plan.
You can begin now.”
Let them build freely. You should walk around, observe, take notes.


4. Midpoint Twist (at ~8 min in)
Optional but great:
“Pause for a moment. You may be starting to realize some teams are missing key pieces.
You're now allowed to talk to other teams and negotiate for parts. You have 3 minutes to trade, share, or beg. Then you must return to building.”
Optional prompt:
“New constraint: It’s now raining. If your cargo isn’t well protected, it may not survive.”


5. Wrap-Up & Debrief (5 min)
“Time’s up! Step away from your builds. Let’s take a quick look at what you made.”
Then ask a few short questions:
“How did your team figure out what the cargo was?”
“What broke down in communication?”
“How did you handle uncertainty and missing pieces?”
“Where did this reflect our real team dynamics?”
