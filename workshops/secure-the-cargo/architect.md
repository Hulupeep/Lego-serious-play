# Architect Instructions: Mission – Secure the Cargo
 
You are the **Architect**. You are the only one who knows what the team is building.
 
Your mission is to **guide your team to build something that will get the cargo to its destination safely**.
 
---
 
## What You Know (They Don't)
 
- The “cargo” is a small animal inside a LEGO cage, hidden among the pieces.
- The final structure must be able to **hold and protect this cargo**.
- The team does not know what the cargo is or what the final structure looks like.
 
---
 
## You MAY:
 
- Guide using open-ended questions:
  - “How would you keep something secure?”
  - “Do you think that will hold under pressure?”
  - “Is there enough space for something to fit safely there?”
- Confirm when the team correctly identifies the cargo (“Yes, that’s the right object.”)
- Encourage them to consider safety, shape, balance, and containment
 
---
 
## You MAY NOT:
 
- Say what the object is (e.g., “It’s a dog” or “It’s an animal”)
- Say what the final build is (e.g., “It’s a vehicle” or “It’s a transport cage”)
- Use specific words: **animal, cage, vehicle, box, ferry, crate, ship, transport**
- Give step-by-step instructions
- Touch or point to any LEGO bricks
 
---
 
## Special Twist:
 
- All teams share the same pool of LEGO bricks (in 3 bowls).
- If a piece is missing or needed, you may encourage your team to **negotiate with another team**—but you can’t do it for them.
- Halfway through, the Facilitator may announce a “storm” or other condition. You must adjust your guidance to reflect added pressure (e.g., extra protection).

## Final Reminder:
 
Your job is not to control the build. It’s to guide your team toward discovering how to build something **secure enough**—without ever telling them what it is.
 
How they get there is part of the learning.
 
You’ve got this.
