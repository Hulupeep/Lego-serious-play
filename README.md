 
# LEGO Serious Play Workshop Collection



Welcome to a growing collection of **LEGO Serious Play** workshops designed to improve team collaboration, communication, creative problem-solving, and reflection.



We’re starting with one complete exercise—**Mission: Secure the Cargo**—a hands-on, high-impact session for Scrum, data, product, and cross-functional teams. Over time, this repository will include multiple sessions contributed by facilitators around the world.

## ✨ Mission: Secure the Cargo



A LEGO Serious Play challenge for 3–4 teams (in-person or hybrid), where each team must build something to safely transport an unknown “cargo”… without being told what it is, what it’s for, or what it should look like.



### Core themes:

- Communication under constraint

- Discovery and emergence

- Negotiating scarce resources

- Architect vs. team dynamics

- Applied creativity
