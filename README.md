 
# LEGO Serious Play Workshop Collection



Welcome to a growing collection of **LEGO Serious Play** workshops designed to improve team collaboration, communication, creative problem-solving, and reflection.



We’re starting with one complete exercise—**Mission: Secure the Cargo**—a hands-on, high-impact session for Scrum, data, product, and cross-functional teams. Over time, this repository will include multiple sessions contributed by facilitators around the world.

## ✨ Mission: Secure the Cargo



A LEGO Serious Play challenge for 3–4 teams (in-person or hybrid), where each team must build something to safely transport an unknown “cargo”… without being told what it is, what it’s for, or what it should look like.



### Core themes:

- Communication under constraint

- Discovery and emergence

- Negotiating scarce resources

- Architect vs. team dynamics

- Applied creativity

## 🧱 Workshop Folder Structure



Each workshop in this repo should follow the structure below:



/your-workshop-name ├── README.md ← Overview of the session ├── facilitator-guide.md ← Full facilitator instructions (step-by-step) ├── participant-guide.md ← The version you give to players (no spoilers) ├── architect-instructions.md ← Secret instructions just for the "Architect" ├── remote-play.md ← Tips and tools for running it remotely ├── debrief.md ← Optional: debrief questions + reflection flow ├── /assets ← Images, diagrams, photos of the builds



Each folder should be self-contained and copy-pasteable into a new repo for reuse.
